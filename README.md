## How to Run

Run the program using <i>command line</i> of your favorite.

Format:
`python3 main.py <file_name> <method>`

File has to be put inside `/test` folder and is a text file.

Method is one of:

- `simple-locking` for Simple Locking (Exclusive lock only)
- `optimistic-cc` for Serial Optimistic Concurrency Control (Validation Based Protocol)
- `multiversion-ts-ord-cc` fir Multiversion Timestamp Ordering Concurrency Control

## Usage

We provided several test cases inside `/test` folder. If you wish to simulate another transaction
scenario, create a new text file inside `/test`. Here's the format of the file

- First line: Number of threads running concurrently
- Second line: Variables involved in transactions
- Third line: Transactions, separated with `;` sign. Here's the detail about the format:
  - `R1(X)` for "Thread 1 read from X"
  - `W1(X)` for "Thread 2 write to X"
  - `A1` for "Abort transactions happening in thread 1"
  - `C1` for "Commit transactions happening in thread 1"
